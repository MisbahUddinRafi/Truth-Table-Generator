<b>Project Name:</b> Truth Table Generator

<p>
I learned Java and JavaFX in my second semester. And I have Digital Logic Design course in my upcoming semester. So, I thought that it will be a great job to build a project that can generate the truth table when I will enter a Boolean expression. So, this will help me to revise the concepts that I learned in the last semester, and will also help me in the upcoming semester. So, that's how this project was build.

<br>
I tried to keep everything simple in this project, including the interface, functionalities and the codes. Currently, the project supports these things: 

<h3>Input:</h1> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-> A user will enter a Boolean expression (infix notation)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-> user can use these symbols: AND(.), OR(+), NOT(') and opening '(' and closing brackets ')'.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-> currently, it only supports the primary Boolean operations. In future, I will also add options for other operators. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-> maximum 10 variables are allowed. 

<h3>Output:</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-> when the user will press the generate button, the program will generate the truth table and the postfix notation for the given Boolean expression. But in the truth table, there will be minimal number of columns for keeping the things simple. So, if there are total n variables in the input, there will be n+1 columns in the output: n columns for the n variables, and the last one column for the functions output.

<h3>Future Plan:</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-> add an option to generate truth tables for two expressions, so that we can easily compare them to see if they are equivalent or not. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-> add more Boolean operators (XOR).
